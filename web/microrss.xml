	  	<p>As someone who once belonged to an organization later determined to be a cult, I can tell you that the warning signs are not always obvious. </p>

	  	<p>A few improvements to Script execution: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scripts now run asynchronously, so that they won&apos;t block the UI &#8211; no more spinning beach balls! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added an indeterminate progress bar to the Scripter window to let the user know that the script is running. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a browse command to the Scripting engine. This can conveniently be placed at the end of a script in order to open a localhost URL displaying the local site just updated via the script. </p>
</li>
</ul>

	  	<p>So now the Republicans seem doomed to act like some strange variety of lemmings, unable to turn back from the cliff after their leader has jumped, but unable to turn away. And so they spend every day of their lives dancing along the edge, trying to convince the rest of us how good life will be at the bottom. </p>

	  	<p>I was reading recently about a couple of different situations involving traits of both leadership and followership. Some reflection on these two situations has compelled me to dispense the following bits of wisdom on the subjects of leading and following. Some of these may seem obvious, and some controversial, but they are all equally true and valuable, based on my own experience doing a fair bit of both in a number of different organizations. </p>

	  	<p>We all know that the economy is important. We talk about it every day. But do we ever think aboutâ€¦ how we think about it? How we visualize it? How we&apos;ve been conditioned to think about it, perhaps unknowingly? </p>

	  	<p>It was just a little over four years ago that I remember sitting in front of our TV with our neighbors, watching the election returns, preparing to celebrate. </p>
