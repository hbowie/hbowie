<p>I've been releasing new and improved versions of Notenik fairly regularly over the last couple of months, and it's now up to 2.2.0 in the Mac App Store, with 2.3.0 on the way.</p>
<p>As I write this, my little app now has 7 ratings in the store, and an average rating of 4.9.</p>
<p>I've received emails about the app from a couple of people I've never met before â€” one user in Australia, and another in Finland! Nice to know that my software can be used around the globe.</p>
<p>Brett Terpstra was nice enough to mention my app in one of his <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2019/11/27/web-excursions-for-november-27-2019/">recent blog posts</a>, calling it &quot;intriguing.&quot;</p>
<p>But there's still more to do, and continuing work on Notenik keeps me busy doing something I enjoy.</p>
<p>If you have a Mac, and haven't yet checked it out, then I encourage you to give it a whirl!</p>

<p>A couple of friends/relatives of mine are taking a trip through Rolling Stone's list of the top 500 albums of all time, and commenting on each as we work our way up the list, starting with #500. We represent three different generations of listeners, and each brings his own unique perspective to this fascinating musical journey. See how far we've gotten and follow along. You might even discover some new old music worth a listen or two!</p>

<description>
<p>Implemented a few additional fixes and minor enhancements. Changed scripted sorting so that fields whose labels begin with &quot;seq&quot; will be treated as sequence fields, meaning that numbers will sort in numeric sequence. Added a basic Textile parser that, while far from complete, is good enough for my needs, since I still use Textile on ReasonToRock.com.</p>
