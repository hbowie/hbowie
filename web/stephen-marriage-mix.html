<h1>Stephen&#8217;s Marriage Mix</h1>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t resist! Quite a variety of songs here for your listening pleasure. As usual, I try to present a variety of different perspectives, in order to properly prepare you for yet another new chapter in your life. Hope you enjoy this!  </p>

<p>Here's the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/stephen-marriage-mix/pl.u-76oNJe7IZGabD" target="music">link to the playlist on Apple Music</a>.

<p>&#8220;<strong>Dear Doctor</strong>&#8221; by The Rolling Stones &#8212; The Rolling Stones were no great romantics, as you can tell from their song about an ill-fated marriage. This was from their album &#8220;Beggar&#8217;s Banquet,&#8221; one of my favorites. It came out while I was in college. It&#8217;s interesting how this group from England writes a song about distinctly American characters that they knew only through song. </p>

<p>&#8220;<strong>Somebody to Love You</strong>&#8221; by Delbert McClinton &#8212; &#8220;You need a car with good tires on it, and the right place to eat BBQ.&#8221; I like the way this song places the necessity of having someone to love in the same category with all these other modern necessities. </p>

<p>&#8220;<strong>I&#8217;ll Be Your Lover, Too</strong>&#8221; by Van Morrison &#8212; I&#8217;ve always loved the quiet intimacy of this recording, and the restless, questing accompaniment of the guitar backing Morrison. Lots of great lines here, but I particularly like, &#8220;And so I come, to be the one, who&#8217;s always standing next to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<strong>You&#8217;ll Accompany Me</strong>&#8221; by Bob Seger &#8212; Another quiet song contemplating a life-long commitment. I particularly like these lines:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&#8217;ve seen you smilin&#8217; in the summer sun <br />
I&#8217;ve seen your long hair flying when you run <br />
I&#8217;ve made my mind up that it&#8217;s meant to be  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And also: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some people say that love&#8217;s a losin&#8217; game <br />
You start with fire but you lose the flame <br />
The ashes smolder but the warmth&#8217;s soon gone <br />
You end up cold and lonely on your own <br />
I&#8217;ll take my chances babe, I&#8217;ll risk it all <br />
I&#8217;ll win your love or I&#8217;ll take the fall  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<strong>In My Life</strong>&#8221; by The Beatles &#8212; I particularly like John&#8217;s haunting, gentle, reflective lead vocal on this one. As with most Beatles songs, the whole thing is perfect, so it&#8217;s hard to single out a few lines. They&#8217;re all great. Producer George Martin famously played the harpsichord break on this. </p>

<p>&#8220;<strong>I Knew The Bride (When She Used To Rock&#8217;n Roll)</strong>&#8221; by Nick Lowe &#8212; Another tongue in cheek selection. A great rocker, and one of the few genuinely rocking songs about a wedding. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, take a look at the bridegroom smilin&#8217; pleased as pie, <br />
Shakin&#8217; hands all around with a glassy look in his eye. <br />
He got a real good job and his shirt and tie is nice&#8230;  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<strong>She&#8217;s No Lady</strong>&#8221; by Lyle Lovett &#8212; &#8220;She&#8217;s no lady, she&#8217;s my wife&#8221; is of course the punch line to an old joke. I particularly like this verse:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The preacher asked her, <br />
And she said I do. <br />
The preacher asked me, <br />
And she said &#8220;Yes he does too.&#8221; <br />
And the preacher said <br />
&#8220;I pronounce you 99 to life, <br />
Son, she&#8217;s no lady she&#8217;s your wife.&#8221;  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<strong>Ain&#8217;t Livin&#8217; In Sin No More</strong>&#8221; by Paul Thorn &#8212;  &#8220;Hallelujah! Thank you Jesus!&#8221; How much more do you need to hear! But I like these lines in particular:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It&#8217;s easy to find a lover, <br />
But it&#8217;s hard to find a friend. <br />
So they decided to test the waters <br />
Before they jumped in.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<strong>Silly Heart</strong>&#8221; by Jesse Winchester &#8212; I&#8217;ve always loved this song, with its gentle, bouncing rhythm, and its testament to the value of a silly heart. </p>

<p>&#8220;<strong>Here Comes My Girl</strong>&#8221; by Tom Petty &#8212; Such a great song. How can you argue with lyrics like these?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every now and then I get down to the end of the day <br />
I have to stop and ask myself why I&#8217;ve done it <br />
It just seems so useless to have to work so hard <br />
And nothin&#8217; ever really seems to come from it <br />
And then she looks me in the eye and says <br />
&#8220;We&#8217;re gonna last forever&#8221; <br />
And man, you know I can&#8217;t begin to doubt it <br />
No, &#8216;cause it just feels so good, and so free, and so right, <br />
I know we ain&#8217;t never gonna change our minds about it!  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<strong>Two Hearts</strong>&#8221; by Bruce Springsteen &#8212; &#8220;Two hearts are better than one. Two hearts will get the job done.&#8221; Yes! And then these lines:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was living in a world of childish dreams. <br />
Someday these childish dreams must end, <br />
To become a man and grow up to dream again.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<strong>Rise Up Singing</strong>&#8221; by Trigger Hippy &#8212; Yes, that&#8217;s Jackie Greene vocalizing. Another song about going the distance even when the going gets tough. &#8220;One of these days I&#8217;m gonna rise up, singing with you.&#8221; I love the happy, loose feel of this song. </p>

<p>&#8220;<strong>Thing Called Love</strong>&#8221; by John Hiatt &#8212; Bonnie Raitt also recorded this song, but I love Hiatt&#8217;s original version. So many great lines, set to great, muscular, crackling guitar. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don&#8217;t have to humble yourself to me, <br />
I ain&#8217;t your judge or your king: <br />
And baby, you know you ain&#8217;t no Queen of Sheba.</p>

<p>Baby, We can choose:
you know we ain&#8217;t no amoebas.</p>

<p>Before the laws of God and the laws of man <br />
I take you for my wife, <br />
To love, honor, cherish and obey. <br />
Now, I didn&#8217;t have no plans to live <br />
This kind of life, <br />
It just worked out that way!  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<strong>Sugar Magnolia</strong>&#8221; by the Grateful Dead &#8212; What a great love song. Here are my favorite lines (a Willys, by the way, is an older sort of jeep):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She can dance a Cajun rhythm, <br />
Jump like a Willys in four wheel drive. <br />
She&#8217;s a summer love in the spring, fall and winter, <br />
She can make happy any man alive.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Has any man ever said sweeter words about his love?</p>

<p>&#8220;<strong>Up On Cripple Creek</strong>&#8221; by The Band. Another great love song. Lots of great lyrics, but these might be worth a comment (the &#8220;box&#8221; is a radio, and Spike Jones was a musical satirist, and a &#8220;pull&#8221; is of course a drink straight from the liquor bottle):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now me and my mate were back at the shack <br />
We had Spike Jones on the box. <br />
She said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t take the way he sings <br />
But I love to hear him talk.&#8221; <br />
Now that just gave my heart a throb <br />
To the bottom of my feet. <br />
And I swore, as I took another pull, <br />
My Bessie can&#8217;t be beat.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<strong>It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry</strong>&#8221; by Bob Dylan &#8212; I&#8217;ve always loved this song. Far from a traditional love song, but how could I send you off into marriage without a train song? Such a nice, loping rhythm, and plaintive harmonica. Electric guitar probably by Mike Bloomfield. And such simple, yet cryptic lyrics, with a title that never appears anywhere within. &#8220;I wanna be your lover, baby, I don&#8217;t wanna be your boss.&#8221; Well, that&#8217;s pretty clear. But then, &#8220;Don&#8217;t say I never warned you when your train gets lost.&#8221; Something here about being able to be still, and alone, and sad, even when you&#8217;re happy to be part of a couple. </p>

<p>&#8220;<strong>Questions</strong>&#8221; by the Buffalo Springfield &#8212; Had to include a song by your namesake, Stephen Stills. Not an obvious love song, but an important one, I think, implying it&#8217;s not so much a matter of having the right answers, but of asking the right questions. Worth many hours of therapy. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now that we&#8217;ve found each other, <br />
Where do we go now? <br />
I&#8217;d like to know what you&#8217;re thinking: <br />
Answer me slowly now. <br />
The questions of a thousand dreams, <br />
What you do and what you see. <br />
Come on lover, talk to me.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<strong>Hot Potatoes</strong>&#8221; by The Kinks. Ray Davies and company bring us back down to the earth for the final number in this playlist, suggesting that these mundane details of everyday married life have their own significance. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I said I don&#8217;t need your fancy cooking, <br />
I like the simple things in life, <br />
Just give me those plain hot potatoes <br />
And I&#8217;ll be well satisfied, <br />
They&#8217;ll satisfy my appetite.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>May these songs help prepare you for the many facets of the great adventure on which you're about to embark!</p>

<p>Love always,</br>
<p>Dad</p>
