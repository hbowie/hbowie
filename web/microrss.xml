Some reflection on these two situations has compelled me to dispense the following bits of wisdom on the subjects of leading and following. Some of these may seem obvious, and some controversial, but they are all equally true and valuable, based on my own experience doing a fair bit of both in a number of different organizations. </p>

	  	<p>We all know that the economy is important. We talk about it every day. But do we ever think aboutâ€¦ how we think about it? How we visualize it? How we&apos;ve been conditioned to think about it, perhaps unknowingly? </p>
