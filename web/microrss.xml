	  	<p>When we look at the major societal choices facing us today, the primary question is not whether we want a society that is more cooperative or more competitive, but whether we&apos;re ready for a society that is less coercive. </p>

	  	<p>As with many of us, I&apos;ve been thinking deeply lately about the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breanna Taylor, and so many other people of color, and wondering how and why these atrocities continue to occur in my country, and what we can do to turn things around. </p>
