	  	<p>Social distancing and wearing of face masks have become the new normal for most of us, thanks to the continued threat of COVID-19. And yet, as ever more people work from home, and more students attempt remote learning, I&apos;m concerned about a growing chorus of folks who are celebrating this enforced distancing as a welcome wave of the future, and suggesting that what started as a temporary fix should be embraced as a permanent fixture of 21st century society. </p>

	  	<p>When historians look at the long span of our human history, they try to make sense of our arc of cultural evolution by breaking it up into phases: the agrarian era, the industrial era, the digital era, and so forth. </p>
<p>But of course, there are multiple perspectives we can use for this sort of exercise. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most important perspective to consider is the relationship of our human population to the rest of our world. </p>

	  	<p>Many of the things that our current president came to stand for were around before his candidacy – and, in fact, helped him to get elected – and they won&apos;t simply vanish on their own. If we&apos;re foolish enough to think they will, then we&apos;re engaging in as much magical thinking as The Donald is when he claims that COVID-19 will simply disappear all by itself. </p>
