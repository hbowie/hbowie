<p>My little Mac app is now up to version 3.0.0, is up to 10 ratings in the Mac app store, and still has an average rating of 4.9! I&apos;ve received lots of feedback about the app over the last few months, and the latest release is better than ever! </p>

<p>As users of computers, do we really want our experiences to be so carefully and intentionally and restrictively designed for us? </p>

<p>I want to take a moment to offer up a prayer – not to God, but to all of us – for a more integral sense of who we are in the new year. </p>

<p>I&apos;ve been releasing new and improved versions of Notenik fairly regularly over the last couple of months, and it&apos;s now up to 2.2.0 in the Mac App Store, with 2.3.0 on the way. </p>
<p>As I write this, my little app now has 7 ratings in the store, and an average rating of 4.9. </p>
<p>I&apos;ve received emails about the app from a couple of people I&apos;ve never met before — one user in Australia, and another in Finland! Nice to know that my software can be used around the globe.  <br />
</p>
<p>Brett Terpstra was nice enough to mention my app in one of his <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2019/11/27/web-excursions-for-november-27-2019/">recent blog posts</a>, calling it &quot;intriguing.&quot; </p>
<p>But there&apos;s still more to do, and continuing work on Notenik keeps me busy doing something I enjoy. </p>
<p>If you have a Mac, and haven&apos;t yet checked it out, then I encourage you to give it a whirl! </p>
