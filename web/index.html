			<p>As someone who once belonged to an organization later determined to be a cult, I can tell you that the warning signs are not always obvious. </p>

			<p>A few improvements to Script execution: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scripts now run asynchronously, so that they won't block the UI &#8211; no more spinning beach balls! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added an indeterminate progress bar to the Scripter window to let the user know that the script is running. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a browse command to the Scripting engine. This can conveniently be placed at the end of a script in order to open a localhost URL displaying the local site just updated via the script. </p>

			<p>So now the Republicans seem doomed to act like some strange variety of lemmings, unable to turn back from the cliff after their leader has jumped, but unable to turn away. And so they spend every day of their lives dancing along the edge, trying to convince the rest of us how good life will be at the bottom. </p>

			</a>
			<p>I was reading recently about a couple of different situations involving traits of both leadership and followership. Some reflection on these two situations has compelled me to dispense the following bits of wisdom on the subjects of leading and following. Some of these may seem obvious, and some controversial, but they are all equally true and valuable, based on my own experience doing a fair bit of both in a number of different organizations. </p>

			<p>No matter where you stand on the political spectrum, questions surrounding free speech are hot-button items these days. Should anyone be free to say anything, about anyone, at any time, and to any audience? If not, who's responsible for moderation, and what are the rules? And at what point does moderation become censorship? </p>

			<p>Practopian.org now takes you to a website hosted on Pantheon, built using Drupal 8. Most of the same content is available on the new site, but the whole thing is now built dynamically, rather than using static pages. The menu navigation is improved, and the overall look has changed a bit. </p>

			</a>
			<p>Social distancing and wearing of face masks have become the new normal for most of us, thanks to the continued threat of COVID-19. And yet, as ever more people work from home, and more students attempt remote learning, I'm concerned about a growing chorus of folks who are celebrating this enforced distancing as a welcome wave of the future, and suggesting that what started as a temporary fix should be embraced as a permanent fixture of 21st century society. </p>

			</a>
			<p>When historians look at the long span of our human history, they try to make sense of our arc of cultural evolution by breaking it up into phases: the agrarian era, the industrial era, the digital era, and so forth. </p>
<p>But of course, there are multiple perspectives we can use for this sort of exercise. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most important perspective to consider is the relationship of our human population to the rest of our world. </p>

			<p>Many of the things that our current president came to stand for were around before his candidacy – and, in fact, helped him to get elected – and they won't simply vanish on their own. If we're foolish enough to think they will, then we're engaging in as much magical thinking as The Donald is when he claims that COVID-19 will simply disappear all by itself. </p>

			</a>
			<p>I've been releasing new and improved versions of Notenik fairly regularly over the last couple of months, and it's now up to 2.2.0 in the Mac App Store, with 2.3.0 on the way. </p>
<p>As I write this, my little app now has 7 ratings in the store, and an average rating of 4.9. </p>
<p>I've received emails about the app from a couple of people I've never met before — one user in Australia, and another in Finland! Nice to know that my software can be used around the globe.  </p>
<p>Brett Terpstra was nice enough to mention my app in one of his <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2019/11/27/web-excursions-for-november-27-2019/">recent blog posts</a>, calling it &#8220;intriguing.&#8221; </p>
<p>But there's still more to do, and continuing work on Notenik keeps me busy doing something I enjoy. </p>
<p>If you have a Mac, and haven't yet checked it out, then I encourage you to give it a whirl! </p>

			<p>A couple of friends/relatives of mine are taking a trip through Rolling Stone's list of the top 500 albums of all time, and commenting on each as we work our way up the list, starting with #500. We represent three different generations of listeners, and each brings his own unique perspective to this fascinating musical journey. See how far we've gotten and follow along. You might even discover some new old music worth a listen or two! </p>

			<p>Implemented a few additional fixes and minor enhancements. Changed scripted sorting so that fields whose labels begin with &#8220;seq&#8221; will be treated as sequence fields, meaning that numbers will sort in numeric sequence. Added a basic Textile parser that, while far from complete, is good enough for my needs, since I still use Textile on ReasonToRock.com. </p>

				<h3 class="post-title">Elizabeth Warren in Seattle</h3>
			</a>
			<p>I was one of the 15,000 people who gathered under the Space Needle yesterday to hear Warren speak. There were several things about her that impressed me. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>She emphasized the need for structural change, starting with getting big money out of politics. This just makes so much sense because, without it, we'll soon be right back where we are now. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She talked about the need for a wealth tax. This really clicked for me yesterday for the first time. I got it. People don't like income tax, because everyone has income, and no one wants to lose any of it to taxation. On the other hand, not everyone has wealth — especially as Warren defines it, above $50 million. So it will be easier to get voters to accept a new wealth tax than increases in income tax. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of her opening origin story, she talked a lot about her &#8220;much older&#8221; brothers. It wasn't until I was riding home on the bus afterwards that I realized how smart this was, because it makes her sound much younger than her 70 years. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, she seems like a smart policy person who genuinely has our country's best interests at heart. but also a smart campaigner. </p>

<p>I’d been doing some regular programming in Java over the past couple of decades, but decided this year to bite the bullet and try to learn Swift, Apple’s latest development language, and chose the Mac as my first target platform. It’s been quite an adventure to create a full-fledged Mac App in a new language, but I’m happy to report that I’ve finally crossed the goal line! More improvements to come, but I believe that version 1.0 is quite serviceable. And it’s free! </p>
