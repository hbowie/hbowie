<p>Remarks for Wedding</p>

<p>As we prepare to further celebrate Stephen and Shannon's happy union today, I find myself reminded of a parent-teacher conference that Pauline and I attended when Stephen was in fourth grade, growing up in Scottsdale, Arizona. </p>

<p>Stephen's teacher -- Mr. Friedman, if I remember correctly -- started the conference by saying that he had been feeling some concern about Stephen's behavior in class. There were times, he told us, when he was providing verbal instruction to the students, that Stephen seemed to be paying little or no attention to the teacher standing in front of him. Instead, Stephen seemed to be giving his full attention to the business of flying his #2 pencil over and around his desk. </p>

<p>As you may well imagine, at this point in the conference, Pauline and I both grew somewhat concerned. Had we inadvertently been doing something at home to encourage this sort of inattentiveness? What sort of remedial action could we take to get Stephen back on the right track? And for me, personally, as a student who, at a somewhat later age, had read several James Bond novels during my seventh-grade math class, had I somehow contributed to this unproductive behavior?</p>

<p>However, Stephen's teacher then went on to provide us with further information. He said that he had quizzed Stephen repeatedly, asking him questions about the information that he had just conveyed to the class, and Stephen had been able to readily answer each question correctly. And so, despite all appearances, Stephen had been learning his lessons. As it turned out, Mr. Friedman concluded, we had nothing to worry about. </p>

<p>This discussion often came back to me in later years because, as Pauline and I had occasion to observe Stephen's dating patterns, we sometimes thought we knew how Mr. Friedman must have felt. Was he really paying attention? Did he have a definite goal in mind? Was all of this leading anywhere? Or was he merely...playing?</p>

<p>But, as a book recommendation from Stephen's best man today recently made clear to me, play is often more productive than it may at first seem. And as Pauline and I began to hear about Shannon, and had a chance to meet her, we began to feel, as Mr. Friedman ultimately did, that Stephen had, indeed, been paying attention. </p>

<p>And so, today, as Stephen and Shannon, along with the supportive community around them, celebrate the progression of their relationship onto a heightened stage of commitment to one another, I ask you all to join me in saying... here's to playing around, and here's to finally getting it right.</p>
