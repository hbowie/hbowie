If someone were to at some point buy me a new iphone, I would be exceedingly pleased to find that the phone purchased was in space grey.

Stephen: your current iPhone is 16GB, and its two-year plan ends on your birthday (no coincidence there!).

Pauline: your current iPhone is 16GB also, and its two-year plan expires just before Christmas!

With Christmas and birthday season approaching, youâ€™d better make your color preferences known!

New phones come in Silver, Space Gray, White and Rose Gold!
